## Vibes

This group has a very DIY, "oh yeah, forgot about that, good idea!" kind of a vibe. We share in the setup and teardown of the very neighborhood-y space. If you're feeling like your question hasn't been answered, ask, no worries. 

Discussions during the peer conference are [facilitated with K-cards](https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/structuring-group-discussions-with-k-cards/) and, while insightful, generally not annoying. 

We have a short and simple code of conduct: kindness, consideration, respect.

Most attendees drive to the event, so there'll be extra spots for a ride to the event, dinner, or the hike the following day.

## Costs

LLEWT is not-for-profit and not a scam. 

Shared costs in the past have roughly come to Â£50-75 per person to pay to rent the parish hall, the scribe (sketchnotes and illustration), and breakfast and lunch for the day of the event. This is typically paid via Paypal to Chris. 

Other individual costs will include: dinner the night before and after the conference, a minimum of one night's stay in or near Llandegfan, and transportation to and from the area.

## Advice about the location

Llandegfan (pronounce the double-l like hl) is located on the island of Angelesey off the northwest corner of Wales, just across the water from Bangor. Snowdonia National Park is the thing you may have heard of that's nearby. 

### How to get there

- By air: Liverpool is the closest airport, followed by Manchester, Birmingham, and London-area airports. 
- By car: Use your car! Reminder that the British drive on the left side of the road. 
- By train: From London, go to Euston station and take the Avanti West Coast train to Bangor or the comically-long named Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch where you can catch a bus or schedule a cab to Llandegfan. 
- By boat: There's a ferry from Dublin to Holyhead at the far west end of the island of Angelesey. The train goes from Holyhead to Bangor or the comically-long named Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch where you can catch a bus or schedule a cab to Llandegfan. 

### Where to stay

With Anglesey being a holiday destination and Bangor University close by, there's no shortage of options. Airbnb and camping are popular choices.
Regarding location, Menai Bridge and Beaumaris are the two largest towns nearest to LLandegfan.

Bangor is just over the water from Menai Bridge, and Caernarfon is a 20-minute drive away. 

### When to do what

The event has been held on the last Saturday of June for all three editions so far. The date for 2025 will be Saturday July 12th. 

There are a couple milestones ahead of the event: 

1. Get invited and tell Chris and Joep you're coming. The invitation usually comes in the winter. (RSVPs are relatively flexible and mostly affect food and restaurant reservation prep in the two weeks leading up to the event.)
2. Experience reports are due approximately a month before the event. 
3. Joep invited voting / participant input on which submissions we wanted to hear last time, and took those into account when creating the program a week ahead of the event. 

The rough schedule for what happens each day of the trip so you know how to plan:

- Thursday: Hike, weather permitting
- Friday: Dinner together in Menai Bridge or Bangor
- Saturday: Peer conference at the Llandedgan Parish Hall, followed by dinner together in Menai Bridge or Bangor
- Sunday: Hike, regardless of the weather

On Saturday, the peer conference schedule usually looks something like: 

- 09:30 opening, introductions & check-in
- 09:45 talks & discussion
- 12:30 lunch & walk
- 14:30 more talks & discussion
- 18:00 closing

Breaks are co-determined by the facilitator and the rest of the participants.
