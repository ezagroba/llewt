## Vibes

This group has a very DIY, "oh yeah, forgot about that, good idea!" kind of a vibe. We share in the setup and teardown of the very neighborhood-y space. If you're feeling like your question hasn't been answered, ask, no worries. 

We have a short and simple code of conduct: kindness, consideration, respect.

Most attendees drive to the event, so there'll be extra spots for a ride to the event, dinner, or the hike the following day. 


## But what is it?

LLEWT is a peer conference, meaning the main goal is to confer with peers.

Each participant is expected to prepare an experience report related to the theme of the conference. An experience report is a story about something you experienced and your reflections about that experience. It should take about 10-15 minutes to present it to the group.

After the presentation we have a group discussion about the experience report, [facilitated with K-cards](https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/structuring-group-discussions-with-k-cards/). These discussions tend to - and are meant to - last significantly longer than the presentation. We prefer a curious attitude over a challenging one during these discussions and asking permission before challenging the presenter on their experience or reflection.

Due to time constraints not every participant will be presenting their experience report. So take that into account when preparing. Don't go full conference talk-level. Prepare what you need to convey your story and kick off the group discussion.

Who gets to present is decided ahead of time by Joep with input from the participants. The reason for this is to have a single person to address when you have any issues with the program.

## Costs

LLEWT is not-for-profit and not a scam. 

Shared costs in the past have roughly come to Â£50-75 per person to pay to rent the parish hall, the scribe (sketchnotes and illustration), and breakfast and lunch for the day of the event. This is typically paid via Paypal to Chris. 

Other individual costs will include: dinner the night before and after the conference, a minimum of one night's stay in or near Llandegfan, and transportation to and from the area.

## Advice about the location

Llandegfan (pronounce the double-l like hl) is located on the island of Angelesey off the northwest corner of Wales, just across the water from Bangor. Snowdonia National Park is the thing you may have heard of that's nearby. 

### How to get there

- By air: Liverpool is the closest airport, followed by Manchester, Birmingham, and London-area airports. 
- By car: Use your car! Reminder that the British drive on the left side of the road. 
- By train: From London, go to Euston station and take the Avanti West Coast train to Bangor or the comically-long named Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch where you can catch a bus or schedule a cab to Llandegfan. 
- By boat: There's a ferry from Dublin to Holyhead at the far west end of the island of Angelesey. The train goes from Holyhead to Bangor or the comically-long named Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch where you can catch a bus or schedule a cab to Llandegfan. 

### Where to stay

With Anglesey being a holiday destination and Bangor University close by, there's no shortage of options. Airbnb and camping are popular choices.
Regarding location, Menai Bridge and Beaumaris are the two largest towns nearest to LLandegfan.

Bangor is just over the water from Menai Bridge, and Caernarfon is a 20-minute drive away. 

### When to do what

The event has been held on the last Saturday of June for all three editions so far. The date for 2025 will be Saturday July 12th. The theme for 2025 is "Rules and constraints to ensure better quality."

There are a couple milestones ahead of the event: 

1. Get invited and tell Chris and Joep you're coming. The invitation usually comes in the winter. (RSVPs are relatively flexible and mostly affect food and restaurant reservation prep in the two weeks leading up to the event.)
2. Experience reports are due approximately a month before the event. 
3. Joep invited voting / participant input on which submissions we wanted to hear last time, and took those into account when creating the program a week ahead of the event. 

The rough schedule for what happens each day of the trip so you know how to plan:

- Thursday: Hike, weather permitting
- Friday: Dinner together in Menai Bridge or Bangor
- Saturday: Peer conference at the Llandedgan Parish Hall, followed by dinner together in Menai Bridge or Bangor
- Sunday: Hike, regardless of the weather

On Saturday, the peer conference schedule usually looks something like: 

- 09:30 opening, introductions & check-in
- 09:45 talks & discussion
- 12:30 lunch & walk
- 14:30 more talks & discussion
- 18:00 closing

Breaks are co-determined by the facilitator and the rest of the participants.
